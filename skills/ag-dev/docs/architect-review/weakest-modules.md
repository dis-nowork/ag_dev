# Weakest Modules

1. **server.js** - Monolithic structure makes it the biggest risk
2. **store.ts** - State management complexity growing rapidly
3. **SuperSkills Security** - Direct process execution is dangerous
4. **Temporal Graph** - Over-engineered solution creates maintenance burden
5. **Error Handling** - Lacks comprehensive error recovery
