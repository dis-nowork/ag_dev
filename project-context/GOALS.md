## Primary Goal
Build a production-ready autonomous development system that can self-manage, multiply agents, and handle complex development workflows through the Ralph Loop pattern.

## Success Criteria
- Ralph Loop can autonomously execute multi-step development tasks
- Quality gates prevent broken code from being committed
- Learning system captures and applies insights across iterations
- System can spawn, coordinate, and manage multiple agent instances
- Terminal management supports auto-restart and fault tolerance

## Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Clawdbot infrastructure
- Cannot modify core working components without backup
- All changes must be additive and backward-compatible
